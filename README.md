# MSTHN
The official PyTorch implementation for Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Hypergraph Network for Next POI Recommendation, which is accepted to DASFAA2023 (CCF-B).

## Overview
Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Hypergraph Network (MSTHN) designs a local spatial-temporal enhanced graph neural network, 
to capture important spatial-temporal correlations during aggregation and propagation, and a global interactive hypergraph neural network
to uncover complex high-order collaborative signals and mitigate check-in data sparsity issue for next POI recommendation.
